                            and daring films of all time to defy genre. It's a raunchy comedy that turns into a road
                            movie that turns into a romance that turns into a dark and violent thriller. Jeff Daniels
                            and Melanie Griffith both give fantastic lead performances, but the late, great Ray Liotta,
                            in his breakout role, steals the show. His entrance signifies what is quite possibly the
                            best
                            and most effective tonal shift ever to be found in a mainstream American movie. This is the
                            late, great Jonathan Demme's best directorial effort amongst a career's worth of wonderful
                            films.</p>

                            stylish, classy, and refined, elevating the movie above its genre significantly. Make no

                            Die Hard is an action movie through and through, it's just made with more care, artistry,

                            the second that he
                            had
                            produced (after his writing and directing debut with 1992's Reservoir Dogs). It's an

                            entertaining, deeply romantic, and hyper-violent depiction of young love. Part of what makes

                            so
                            great is that it combines Tarantimo's indie sensibilities with director Tony Scott's (Top

                            provocative, and most ingenious movies ever made. Robocop works as a science fiction
                            action/thriller
                            and as a profound piece of social commentary that examines corporational greed, the ethical

                            that can come with advancing technology, and the essence of what it means to be human.

                            all time. It's the
                            Coen Borthers at their quirkiest and most absurd, but it's also them at their most astute
                            and
                            emotionally moving. Raising Arizona is like a Looney Tunes cartoon made for adults. It's
                            silly and absurd, but also wholly sophisticated with wonderous moments of whimsey and
                            sincere moments that honestly depict the human condition. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter,
                            both early in their careers whent they made the film, are at their aboslute best--no small
                            feat for either of their enormous talents.</p>

                            film that
                            thoughfully
                            examines the feelings and consequences associated with working in a repressive bureaucratic
                            enviornment. Brazil is about the importance of holding onto dreams and ideals that lift us

                            America. It is a
                            strange
                            and mind-blowing thriller/mystery that is as shocking and disturbing today as it was when it
                            was
                            released back in 1986. Lynch brought surrealism to popular culture with this film in a way
                            that
                            had
                            never before been done and hasn't been done since. Simply put, there is nothing quite like
                            Blue
                            Velvet. To this day, Dennis Hopper's portrayal of the psychotic Frank Booth remains as one
                            of
                            the
                            best villains ever put on film.</p>

                        <p class="top10pright">David Lynch's free-form adaptation of Barry Gifford's wonderful novel,
                            Wild at Heart, is a
                            violent,
                            funny, colorful, exciting, and sexy romp. It is the single most entertaining and thoroughly
                            whacked
                            out movie of Lynch's career--and that says a lot. Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern star as a
                            crazy-in-love couple who go on the run from the law, disturbed family members, and dangerous
                            hitmen.
                            Wild at Heart is, simply put, one of the wildest and most inventive road movies of all time.

                        <p class="top10pleft">Tim Burton's classic is the definitive movie about lonelieness and
                            alienation. Edward
                            Scissorhands
                            (portrayed by Johnny Deep) is the ultimate outsider--someone who literally can't touch
                            anything
                            without destroyig it. He is a character who symbolizes racial discrimination, sexism,
                            prejudice
                            towards those with disabilities, and anyone else who is mistreated for being a little
                            different.
                            Edward Scissorhands is a modern-day fairy tale that teaches us an important lesson about the
                            treatment of those who don't (or are unable to) fit in with social norms. It is a
                            beautifully
                            sad
                            and heartbreakingly honest film about what it feels like to be an outsider.</p>

                        <p class="top10pright">Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is arguably the most influential movie of the
                            past forty years.
                            At
                            the
                            very least, it's one of them, as it has influenced countless other films, music videos,
                            commercials,
                            and comics since its release. It is the most obsessively and beautifully detailed science
                            fiction
                            film since Stanley Kubrick's 2001, and it arguably even goes further than that undisputed
                            classic.
                            Blade Runner's designs are so meticulously executed that they allow you to make surprising
                            new
                            discoveries with each new viewing of the film--regardless of how many times you've seen it.
                            Blade
                            Runner is, quite simply, the most beautifully and painstakingly crafted film of all time.
