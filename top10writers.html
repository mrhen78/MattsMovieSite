                <img class="stahlimage" src="images/top10writers/stahl.jpg" alt="Jerry Stalh">
                <p>Jerry Stahl is the best writer of his generation. He is best known for his sardonic wit, affinity for
                    dark humor, frank observations on fringe lifestyles, satirical brilliance, and unlfinching honesty.
                    His most renowned work is the addiction memoir, Permanent Midnight. He has also written such novels
                    as Pev: A Love Story, Plainclothes Naked, and I, Fatty. Stahl is also a screenwriter, having most
                    famously co-written Bad Boys 2 and written for such series as ALF and CSI: Crime Scene Invesigation.

                <h3>2. Steve Martin</h3>
                <img src="images/top10writers/martin.jpg" alt="Steve Martin dressed up">
                <p>Steve Martin is not only one of the most popular comedic actors of all time, he's also an
                    accomplished writer in several different mediums. Aside from collections of humorous short stories,
                    plays, screenplays, and an autobiography, Martin has written a few short novels. Shopgirl, The
                    Pleasure of My Company, and An Object of Beauty are all surprisingly thoughtful character studies
                    from a man who first started his career as a Wild and Crazy Guy.</p>

                <h3>3. Roger Ebert</h3>
                <img src="images/top10writers/ebert.jpg" alt="Roger Ebert smiling">
                <p>Roger Ebert is, arguably, the most influential and respected film critic of his time. No one has come
                    close to possessing his intergrity, passion, and knowledge since he passed. He respected the films
                    he reviewed, and his reviews were as thoughtful as they were singularly opinionated. There is no
                    other film critic working today who can match the talents or the heart of Roger Ebert. </p>

                <h3>4. Grant Morrison</h3>
                <img src="images/top10writers/morrison.jpg" alt="Grant Morrison smiling">
                <p>Grant Morrison is one of the most audacious talents that the comic book industry has ever seen. He
                    takes familiar superhero characters (Batman, Superman, etc) and explores them with a unique point of
                    view that incorporates metaphysics, surrealism, and a variety of philosophical viewpoints.
                    Morrison's highly renowned original comic, The Invisibles, was an enormous influence on the classic
                    Matrix films. </p>

                <img src="images/top10writers/zahler.jpg" alt="S. Craig Zahler smiling">
                <p>In a very short period of time, S. Craig Zahler has written several books and screenplays, regularly
                    performed in his heavy metal band, Realmbuilder, drawn and written his own comic book, and has
                    directed three great movies, Bone Tomahawk, Brawl in Cell Block 99, and Dragged Across Concrete. His
                    work ethic is unstoppable, his talents are immeasurable, and his style impressively bends to the
                    demands of each of his individual projects.</p>

                <h3>6. Daniel Waters</h3>
                <img src="images/top10writers/waters.jpg" alt="Daniel Waters while speaking">
                <p>Daniel Waters is one of the wittiest, most bitingly satirical, and most intelligently off-kilter
                    screenwriters working in Hollywood today. He has independent tastes, but has used them to create
                    highly unique and individulistic works in the mainstream. Waters is best-known for writing the
                    teenage dark comedy classic, Heathers. Significantly, he also wrote Batman Returns and Demolition
                    Man in the early 90s.</p>

                <h3>7. Caroline Thompson</h3>
                <img src="images/top10writers/thompson.jpg" alt="Caroline Thompson with a half-smile">
                <p>Caroline Thompson started her career with the darkly comedic novel, First Born, which is about an
                    abortion that comes back to life. She is best-known as a screenwriter for her collaborations with
                    director/producer Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Corpse Bride.
                    Her uniquely idiosynchratic tastes make her one of the most original and memorable screenwriters of
                    her generation.</p>

                <h3>8. Bret Easton Ellis</h3>
                <img src="images/top10writers/ellis.jpg" alt="Bret Easton Ellis taking a picture with a phone">
                <p>Bret Easton Ellis' novels read like a strange cross between a Vogue magazine article and a David
                    Lynch film. Ellis is a satirist who targets American materialism and the country's flood of
                    dsyfunctional familial relationships. His work is often unforgettalbe, sometimes graphically
                    violent, and always emotionally raw and honest. Ellis unfortunately hasn't written a novel in quite
                    some time, as he has been more focused recently on his podcast and on writing screenplays. </p>

                <h3>9. Albert Brooks</h3>
                <img src="images/top10writers/brooks.jpg" alt="Albert Brooks in a still image from his film, Real Life">
                <p>Albert Brooks is reponsible for writing, directing, and acting in some of the most insightful,
                    honest, and downright funny comedies of his time. Modern Romance, Lost in America, and Defending
                    Your Life are just a few examples of Brooks' observational, character-driven, and neuroses-fueled
                    brand of comedy. Though his films have never been huge mainstream hits (he is perhaps best known for
                    displaying his vocal talents in Finding Nemo), Brooks' filmmaking efforts will be appreciated by his
                    substantial and loyal fanbase for many years to come.</p>

            <div class="tarantino">
                <h3>10. Quentin Tarantino</h3>
                <img src="images/top10writers/tarantino.jpg" alt="Quentin Tarantino smirking">
                <p>It's easy to hate Quentin Tarantino. He's too arrogant, too famous, and far too successful to be as
                    good as everyone says/thinks he is. That being said, Tarantino's talent is impossible to ignore.
                    While most of his later work doesn't match the fireworks display of his early work, it is impossible
                    to deny that the man who created Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, and Natural Born
                    Killers possesses one of the most gifted and brazen voices of his time. </p>
